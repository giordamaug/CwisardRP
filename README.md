Description
----------------------

CwisardRP is a change detection method in video processing based on a weightless neural system, 
namely WiSARDrp, with the aim of exploiting its features of being highly adaptive and 
noiseâ€“tolerance at runtime.
In CwisardRP, the changing pixel colors in a video are processed by a an incremental 
learning neural network with a limited-in-time memory-retention mechanism that allow the
proposed system to absorb small variations of the learned model (background) 
in the steady state of operation as well as to  fastly adapt to background 
changes during the video timeline.

Compile/Run CwisardRP source (Linux, Mac OSX)
----------------------

To run the code the following libraries are required:

1. OpenCV 3.0 (later versions may also work)

2. CMake  3.0  (later version may also work)

3. C++ Compiler (tested only with GCC 5.x or later versions)

```
$ cmake .
$ make
$ cwisard  -P <video-folder>
```
